\chapter{Impact statement}

% The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis,
% discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits both
% inside and outside academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

% The benefits inside academia could be to the discipline and future scholarship, research methods
% or methodology, the curriculum; they might be within your research area and potentially within other
% research areas.

% The benefits outside academia could occur to commercial activity, social enterprise, professional
% practice, clinical use, public health, public policy design, public service delivery, laws, public
% discourse, culture, the quality of the environment or quality of life.

% The impact could occur locally, regionally, nationally or internationally, to individuals, communities
% or organizations and could be immediate or occur incrementally, in the context of a broader field of
% research, over many years, decades or longer.

% Impact could be brought about through disseminating outputs (either in scholarly journals or
% elsewhere such as specialist or mainstream media), education, public engagement, translational
% research, commercial and social enterprise activity, engaging with public policy makers and public
% service delivery practitioners, influencing ministers, collaborating with academics and non-academics
% etc.
